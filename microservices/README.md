**AI Microservices - Part 2**

In this part of the project, we'll integrate various IBM Cloud AI microservices (Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech) and a third-party VoIP service (Twilio) with the LLM Virtual Assistant created in Part 1. This enables real-time interaction:

* Users can trigger calls and interact with the LLM Assistant through voice commands.
* The Assistant can respond to user queries using Text-to-Speech.

## Prerequisites

- An active IBM Cloud account: [https://cloud.ibm.com/registration](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration)
- IBM Cloud CLI: [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) installed
- Python 3.10

## Set up IBM Cloud AI Microservices

### Step 1: Create Speech-to-Text service

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
2. Navigate to the Speech-to-Text service: [https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text) in the catalog.
3. Choose a plan, region, and resource group. Provide a unique name for your service and click "Create".
4. Once created, go to the "Manage" tab and copy the API key and URL for later use.

### Step 2: Create Text-to-Speech service

1. Navigate to the Text-to-Speech service: [https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech) in the catalog.
2. Choose a plan, region, and resource group. Provide a unique name for your service and click "Create".
3. Once created, go to the "Manage" tab and copy the API key and URL for later use.

## Set up VoIP Service

IBM Cloud doesn't offer a built-in VoIP service. We'll use Twilio, a third-party provider:

1. Sign up for a Twilio account: [https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
2. Purchase a phone number from the Twilio dashboard.
3. Retrieve your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token from the dashboard.

## Integrate AI Microservices with the Main Server

Once you have set up the AI services, integrate them with the `main.py` code (assuming it houses your LLM assistant interaction logic).

1. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install ibm-watson ibm-cloud-sdk-core twilio
```

2. Update `main.py` with the following code (replace placeholders):

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import dash  # Assuming you're using Dash for the dashboard
from ibm_watson import SpeechToTextV1, TextToSpeechV1
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator
from twilio.rest import Client

# Replace these values with your service credentials
IBM_SPEECH_TO_TEXT_API_KEY = '<your_speech_to_text_api_key>'
IBM_SPEECH_TO_TEXT_URL = '<your_speech_to_text_url>'
IBM_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API_KEY = '<your_text_to_speech_api_key>'
IBM_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_URL = '<your_text_to_speech_url>'

# Replace these values with your Twilio credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = '<your_twilio_account_sid>'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = '<your_twilio_auth_token>'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = '<your_twilio_phone_number>'

# Set up AI services
speech_to_text_authenticator = IAMAuthenticator(IBM_SPEECH_TO_TEXT_API_KEY)
speech_to_text = SpeechToTextV1(authenticator=speech_to_text_authenticator)
speech_to_text.set_service_url(IBM_SPEECH_TO_TEXT_URL)

text_to_speech_authenticator = IAMAuthenticator(IBM_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API_KEY)
text_to_speech = TextToSpeechV1(authenticator=text_to_speech_authenticator)
text_to_speech.set_service_url(IBM_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_URL)

# Set up Twilio client
twilio_client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)


def handle_incoming_call(from_number, to_number):
  """
  This function handles an incoming call by:
  1. Using Twilio to answer the call
  2. Utilizing Speech-to-Text to convert user speech to text
  3. Sending the transcribed text to the LLM Virtual Assistant for processing
  4. Using Text-to-Speech to convert the Assistant's response to audio
  5. Playing the audio response back to the caller

  **Note:** This is a basic example. You may need to implement additional logic
  for handling errors, timeouts, and more complex interactions.
  """

  # Answer the call using Twilio
  call = twilio_client.calls.create(
      url='http://twiml.example.com/answer',  # Replace with your TwiML URL
      to=to_number,
      from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
  )

  # Start recording the call using Speech-to-Text
  speech_recognition_settings = speech_to_text.recognize(
      audio_url=call.sid + '/recordings.json'  # Replace with actual recording URL from Twilio call object
  ).get_result()

  # Extract the transcribed text
  user_question = speech_recognition_settings['results'][0]['alternatives'][0]['transcript']

  # Send the question to the LLM Virtual Assistant (replace with your logic)
  assistant_response = process_question_with_assistant(user_question)

  # Convert the Assistant's response to audio using Text-to-Speech
  synthesize_response = text_to_speech.synthesize(
      text=assistant_response,
      accept='audio/mp3'  # You can choose other audio formats
  ).get_result()

  # Play the audio response back to the caller using TwiML (replace with your logic)
  # ... (implementation using Twilio's TwiML language)

# Integrate this function into your call handling logic within your main server
# (e.g., using a web framework like Flask or a library like Twilio's Python helper)

# Example usage (replace with actual call handling logic)
incoming_call = # Get details of the incoming call (from_number, to_number)
handle_incoming_call(incoming_call.from_, incoming_call.to)
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `handle_incoming_call` function takes the caller's phone number (`from_number`) and the number to call (`to_number`) as arguments.
2. It uses Twilio's API to answer the call using a specific URL (replace the placeholder with your actual TwiML URL). TwiML is a markup language used to instruct Twilio on how to handle calls.
3. While the call is ongoing, it utilizes Speech-to-Text to recognize the user's speech from the recording URL provided by Twilio.
4. Once transcribed, the user's question is extracted.
5. You'll need to replace `process_question_with_assistant` with your actual logic for sending the question to the LLM Virtual Assistant and retrieving the response. This might involve functions from the `langchain` library you used in your previous code.
6. The Assistant's response is then converted to audio using Text-to-Speech.
7. The final step (commented out) involves implementing TwiML code to play the audio response back to the caller.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example. You'll need to integrate this function into your existing call handling logic and implement additional functionalities to handle real-world scenarios.

Certainly! Here's the concluding part of the improved README.md incorporating functionalities for real-world scenarios:

**Remember: functionalities to handle real-world scenarios**

This example provides a basic framework. Here are some additional considerations for real-world applications:

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for potential issues like service outages, failed transcriptions, or unexpected responses from the LLM Assistant. You might want to provide informative messages to the user or retry operations.
- **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for speech recognition and assistant processing to prevent callers from waiting indefinitely.
- **Authentication:** Consider implementing authentication mechanisms to restrict access to your system and prevent unauthorized calls.
- **Call Flow Management:** Design a call flow to guide users through the interaction with the LLM Assistant. You can use TwiML to prompt users for specific information or offer them options for further interaction.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Depending on the complexity of your LLM Assistant, you might need to perform additional NLP tasks before sending the user's question. This could involve tasks like named entity recognition (NER) or sentiment analysis to improve the Assistant's understanding and response.

**Conclusion**

By integrating AI microservices with your LLM Virtual Assistant, you can create a powerful and interactive system to handle user queries through voice calls. Remember to tailor the functionalities and error handling to your specific requirements to ensure a seamless user experience.
